Summary
I have created my own store that sells groceries. The table shows a list of all 20 items in my grocery store, with 5 unique columns (id, item, category, price and sales).

The following questions are then answered to apply SQL learnings:
Display store database by order of sales.
Which is the most expensive item?
What is the average price of items in the 'food cupboard' category?
What is the total amount of items sold?
What are the top 5 items that bought in most sales?
